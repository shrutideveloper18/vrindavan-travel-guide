            local Rajas and in recent decades by apartment developers. The forest cover has been whittled away to only a
            few remaining spots, and the local wildlife, including peacocks, cows, monkeys and a variety of bird species
            has been virtually eliminated.Vrindavan, a sacred town in Uttar Pradesh, India, is known as Lord Krishna's
            childhood home, teeming with hundreds of temples (like Banke Bihari, ISKCON) along the Yamuna River,
